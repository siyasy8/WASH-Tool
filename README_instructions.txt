Step 1:
Run the program in this folder called 'search'. It will open a terminal, follow the instructions it prompts. This program will scrape the internet for proper documents of interest and save them as PDFs.

You must acquire an OpenAI API key. You can get one here: https://openai.com/index/openai-api/. We recommend purchasing a GPT-4 / 4o API key for highly accurate results. Paste this API key into the API_KEY.txt file in this folder.

Step 3:
Run the 'run_app_mac.sh' file in this folder. This will open up the streamlit application in a Chrome tab where you can perform the proper searches as needed.
